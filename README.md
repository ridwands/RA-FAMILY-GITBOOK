# Argo CD Hands On Lab

This lab provides a practical introduction to _Argo CD_, a declarative, GitOps-based continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Participants will learn how to install and configure Argo CD, connect it to a Git repository, and deploy applications to a Kubernetes cluster. The session covers the basic workflow of managing applications through the Argo CD UI and CLI, exploring synchronization, automated deployments, and rollback features. By the end of the lab, participants will have hands-on experience in setting up a GitOps workflow using Argo CD.
